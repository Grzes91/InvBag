Description: The package is an R implementation of the Inverse Bagging algorithm. Given two sets: a training one containing observations from a certain distribution and a testing one which can include as well anomalous observations generated from a different unknown distribution; the algorithm returns scores for the testing set observations related to evidence of their anomalous propoerties.
